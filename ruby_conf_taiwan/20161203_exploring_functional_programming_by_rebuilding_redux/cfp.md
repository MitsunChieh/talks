## Title 
#### Exploring Functional Programming by Rebuilding Redux

## Abstract

The goal of this talk is to introduce basic functional programming concepts. This will be achieved by demonstrating how to rebuild [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), a popular Javascript library, using Ruby. For this purpose, I open-sourced a gem called [Rubidux](https://github.com/davidjuin0519/rubidux), which borrows the model from Redux.

## 簡介

Ruby不僅簡潔、優雅、易用，它還具有一些特性，可以讓我們使用一種古老的程式典範：Functional Programming。講者將透過實作一個著名的 Javascript Library: Redux，來示範如何使用 Ruby 實踐 Functional Programming。

- Functiona are first-class
can be stored in variables and data structures
can be passed as a parameter to a subroutine
can be returned as the result of a subroutine
=> Higher-order function
=> map, filter, reduce, compose
- recursion rather than iterative
- immutability


Why Redux?
- 原始碼短小
- 大量使用
- 良好的文件

## Outline

1. #### What is functional programming (FP)?

  Functional programming is a paradigm of programming.

  Some features are:
  - Describe **what you want** rather than **how you do it**
  - Functions are first-class
  - Higher order functions => map, reduce, filter, compose, curry
  - Lexical closure
  - Referential transparency => pure function
  - Pattern matching
  - Lazy evaluation
  - No side-effects
  - Immutable data

2. #### Why is FP getting popular again?

  - Greater computing power compared to 50 years ago
  - Need for high concurrency application (immutability)
  - Big data (data pipeline infrastructures like Hadoop / Spark)
  
  ##### Can Ruby do functional programming?

  - Ruby is an elegant language
  - Ruby is inspired by LISP
  - Ruby has lambda

  So, yes, Ruby can do FP, technically.

3. #### Introduction to Redux

  Redux is a great choice to get going.

  - Use a lot of FP concepts
  - Tiny
  - Well documented
  - Increasingly used in Javascript apps

4. #### Demonstrating Rubidux

  Including FP concepts and skills such as:
  - Lambda
  - Compose
  - Curry
  - Map / Reduce
  - Lazy evaluation

5. #### Possible use case of Rubidux

  Providing state management for [Reactrb](https://github.com/reactrb/reactrb) (Ruby wrapper for React.js)

6. #### Takeaway messages 

  - Have a sense of using Ruby lambda
  - Know how to complement OO design with FP style
  - Contribute to Rubidux if you like it

## Pitch
### What can I deliver in this talk?

The goal of this talk is to introduce basic functional programming concepts. This will be achieved by demonstrating how to rebuild [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), a popular Javascript library, using Ruby. For this purpose, I open-sourced a gem called [Rubidux](https://github.com/davidjuin0519/rubidux), which borrows the model from Redux.

### Why am I qualified to speak on this topic?

1. Familiar with Redux
2. Spot Ruby's potentials of functional programming
3. Built and open-sourced [Rubidux](https://github.com/davidjuin0519/rubidux) to help Ruby community explore functional programming

### Why should this talk be considered?

1. Explore possibilities of ruby programming
2. Help ruby community advance Ruby skills
3. Introduce the next big-hit concepts for people who are interested in big data
4. Open-sourced gem for further contributions and help ruby community grow
