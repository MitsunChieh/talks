# Functional Programming

  - Describe **what you want** rather than **how you do it**
  - Functions are first-class
  - Higher order functions => map, reduce, filter, compose, curry
  - Lexical closure
  - Referential transparency => pure function
  - Pattern matching
  - Lazy evaluation
  - No side-effects
  - Immutable data
